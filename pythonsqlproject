Inventory Control Management


Learning Objective - Understanding the problem statement and implementing the same using Python and SQL.


Problem Statement - Inventory Control Management helps to identify which and how much stock to order at what time. It tracks inventory from purchase to the sale of goods. Create this project with the help of  the following specifications:


Create a database called “Inventory_Management” with different tables like “manufacture”, “goods”, “purchase”, “sale” etc.

Insert multiple entries to these different tables - “manufacture”, “goods”, “purchase” and “sale”.

In the “manufacture” table, one should be able to see all the products that need to be manufactured, and defective items during the manufacture with different entries like manufacture id, number of items required, etc. 

In the “goods” table, it should include different items that are manufactured by the company along with the goods id, manufactured date, etc.

In the “purchase” table, it should include all the purchase details that are purchased in different online and offline stores, along with the purchase id, purchase amount, etc.

In the “sale” table, it should include all the items got sold in different stores with the sale date, profit margin, etc

Delete the defective item, e.g., the shirt which was accidentally purchased by the “ORay” store, manufactured on the date ‘01-04-23’.

Update the manufacture details of all the red-colored toys which are purchased by the “MyKids” store.

Display all the “wooden chair” items that were manufactured before the 1st May 2023. 

 Display the profit margin amount of the “wooden table” that was sold by the “MyCare” store, manufactured by the “SS Export” company.
